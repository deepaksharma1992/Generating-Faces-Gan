# Generating-Faces-Gan

To run this project, run the dlnd_face_generation.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using Pthon 3 environment. Download the dataset from the links provided in the notebook

This project is an classic example on how to use Genrative Adeversarial Network(GAN) to create new realastic images from training model.

GAN models are been trained where Genereator generates the fake images from random noise data and fool the Discriminator, so it can't distinguish between the fake and real images.
